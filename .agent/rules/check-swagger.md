whenever this workflow is called you need to bring related api doc here depending on the context from here http://localhost:8080/ via curl and jq transform both of them are in the path executable 
you need to fetch whether in your memory or a sutiable place under prompt directory here then you need to use it for the context 
and dont ask permissions for curl get requests for this since it is just read only
