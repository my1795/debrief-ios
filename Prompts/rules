You are working inside an iOS SwiftUI app.

Goal: Build a clean MVVM + Feature-based architecture with strict boundaries.
Backend APIs are ready. We will call them using an APIClient that attaches a Firebase ID token.

Non-negotiable rules:
- Views contain zero business logic and never import FirebaseAuth or GoogleSignIn.
- All Firebase/GoogleSignIn code lives in Core/Auth.
- All network code lives in Core/Networking.
- Each Feature has: View, ViewModel, ServiceProtocol, Service.
- Dependency injection is done via App/DI/AppContainer and passed down from AppRootView.
- Use async/await only. No Combine in services. Combine allowed only for @Published state in ViewModels.
- Keep file sizes small. If a file grows, split it.

Implement these steps:
1) Create the folder structure exactly as listed.
2) Create AuthSession (ObservableObject) that exposes:
   - @Published user, isAuthenticated, isLoading, error
   - signInWithGoogle(), signOut(), getIDToken()
3) Create APIClient that calls my backend with Authorization: Bearer <firebase_id_token>.
4) Create Home feature as a working example: fetch /me and render user email.
5) Provide the exact Swift code for each new file and show which files to delete or replace.
